"Welcome to the Cheat Engine Tutorial (v3.4)\n"
"\n"
"This tutorial will teach you the basics of cheating in video games. It will also show you foundational aspects of using Cheat Engine (or CE for short). Follow the steps below to get started.\n"
"\n"
"1: Open Cheat Engine if it currently isn't running.\n"
"2: Click on the \"Open Process\" icon (it's the top-left icon with the computer on it, below \"File\".).\n"
"3: With the Process List window now open, look for this tutorial's process in the list. It will look something like \"00001F98-Tutorial-x86_64.exe\" or \"0000047C-Tutorial-i386.exe\". (The first 8 numbers/letters will probably be different.)\n"
"4: Once you've found the process, click on it to select it, then click the \"Open\" button. (Don't worry about all the other buttons right now. You can learn about them later if you're interested.)\n"
"\n"
"Congratulations! If you did everything correctly, the process window should be gone with Cheat Engine now attached to the tutorial (you will see the process name towards the top-center of CE).\n"
"\n"
"Click the \"Next\" button below to continue, or fill in the password and click the \"OK\" button to proceed to that step.)\n"

"#3 找到「Tutorial」进程\n"
" ▪ 在进程列表窗口中，将列表拉到底部，找到本教程的进程。\n"
" ▪ 它标题类似 “00001234-Tutorial-x86_64.exe” (前面的八个数字可能会不一样)\n"

" ▪ ->「4C*2 + 00000310」\n"
" ▪ ->「98 + 00000310」\n"
" ▪ ->「98 + 310」\n"
" ▪ ->「3A8」\n"

"Code injection is a technique where you inject a piece of code into the target process, and then reroute the execution of code to go through your own written code.\n"
"\n"
"In this tutorial you'll have a health value and a button that will decrease your health by 1 each time you click it.\n"
"Your task is to use code injection to make the button increase your health by 2 each time it is clicked\n"
"\n"
"Start with finding the address and then find what writes to it.\n"
"then when you've found the code that decreases it browse to that address in the disassembler, and open the auto assembler window (ctrl+a)\n"
"There click on template and then code injection, and give it the address that decreases health (If it isn't already filled in correctly)\n"
"That will generate a basic auto assembler injection framework you can use for your code.\n"
"\n"
"Notice the alloc, that will allocate a block of memory for your code cave, in the past, in the pre windows 2000 systems, people had to find code caves in the memory(regions of memory unused by the game), but that's luckily a thing of the past since windows 2000, and will these days cause errors when trying to be used, due to SP2 of XP and the NX bit of new CPU's\n"
"\n"
"Also notice the line newmem: and originalcode: and the text \"Place your code here\"\n"
"As you guessed it, write your code here that will increase the  health with 2.\n"
"An usefull assembler instruction in this case is the \"ADD instruction\"\n"
"here are a few examples:\n"
"\"ADD [00901234],9\" to increase the address at 00901234 with 9\n"
"\"ADD [ESP+4],9\" to increase the address pointed to by ESP+4 with 9\n"
"In this case, you'll have to use the same thing between the brackets as the original code has that decreases your health\n"
"\n"
"Notice:\n"
"It is recommended to delete the line that decreases your health from the original code section, else you'll have to increase your health with 3 (you increase with 3, the original code decreases with 1, so the end result is increase with 2), which might become confusing. But it's all up to you and your programming.\n"
"\n"
"Notice 2:\n"
"In some games the original code can exist out of multiple instructions, and sometimes, not always, it might happen that a code at another place jumps into your jump instruction end will then cause unknown behavior. If that happens, you should usually look near that instruction and see the jumps and fix it, or perhaps even choose to use a different address to do the code injection from. As long as you're able to figure out the address to change from inside your injected code.\n"

"代码注入是个技术活，你要把一段汇编代码注入到目标进程，让程序执行你的代码。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"在这个教程，你有一个「生命值」 ，以及每按1次就减少1点生命的「打我」按钮。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"◆ 过关条件：注入代码，将「打我」按钮的效果变成每次增加 2 点生命值。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"------------------------------------------------------------------\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"【提示】\n\n"
"和前面第5关操作一样，先找到地址，然后查看谁改写了它。\n"
"\n"
"但是，这里要做的不是“替换”，而是「显示反汇编程序」\n"
"你会看到这行汇编指令大致是这样的：sub dword ptr [ebx+xxxx],01\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"在内存浏览器窗口找到这行汇编指令，然后打开「自动汇编窗口（Ctrl+A）」\n"
"或者通过「菜单栏 - 工具 - 自动汇编」找到它，就在列表最底部。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"在自动汇编窗口点击「模板」，选择代码注入。\n"
"提示需要输入跳转地址，这里会给你自动输入跳转的地址，直接点击确定即可。如果它没有自动填入，那你可能要自己输入地址。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"接着窗口中会生成一段自动汇编注入的基本代码框架，方便你快速修改。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"注意，把你的代码写在蓝色注释 “place your code here” 的下方。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"先来分析一下原代码的汇编指令：\n"
"sub dword ptr [ebx+xxxx], 01\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"sub 是减法指令。sub a,b，也就是变成 a - b\n"
"这里的意思就是每次将数值减去 1\n"
"\n"
"那么是不是把减法改成加法，就可以了呢？\n"
"\n"
"没错，加法的汇编指令是：ADD\n"
"\n"
"使用例子：\n"
"ADD [00901234],9   —— 将 00901234 地址的数值加 9\n"
"ADD [ESP+4],9      —— 将 ESP+4 指针指向的地址的数值增加 9\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"那么，现在就有很多种方法可以过关了。\n"
"例如直接修改 originalcode 源代码部分，把减少生命值的代码修改。\n"
" ▪ 注释原来的代码，直接替换成增加 2 点生命值？( 0 + 2)\n"
" ▪ 保留原来的代码，在后面补充增加 3 点生命值？(-1 + 3)\n"
"\n"
"反正办法有很多，你自己决定了。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"【补充】\n\n"
"在某些游戏里，原代码可能位于多条指令的跳转之外。这种情况偶尔会发生，但不一定总是这样。\n"
"它可能导致其它地方的一段代码跳转到你的代码后面，导致出现未知的行为。\n"
"\n"
"如果这样，你通常要看看附近是否存在跳转指令来修正它。或者可能要选另一个地址来注入代码，只要你能从你的注入代码里找到要改变的地址。\n"
